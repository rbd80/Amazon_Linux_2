# Ansible notes

Tried to use the public roles but they were configured for Amazon linux and not Amazon linux 2 LTE.  

Used the Amazon Linux CIS controls until the Linux 2 LTE version is ready.

# Walk through on using this playbook

```
 sudo yum install git -y
```

```
git clone https://github.com/rbd80/Amazon_Linux_2.git
```

```
cd Amazon_Linux_2

```
